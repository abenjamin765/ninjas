    <h2>Mariana Benjamin</h2>
    <p>You may recognize me as Mrs. Unicorn from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.weddingbee.com/author/msunicorn/">Weddingbee</a>! It seems I never recovered after being bitten by the wedding bug, so here I am, living vicariously through all our wonderful couples. I like dancing, mojitos, travelling around the world, and meeting new people. I believe in spontaneity and love and passion. While I may be the dreamer behind Photo Ninja, Aaron is the Prince Charming that makes all my dreams come true. Everybody say “Awwww!”</p>
    <p>My geekiness knows no bounds; I love Doctor Who, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Star Trek, and so on and so forth. Talk nerdy to me.</p>
